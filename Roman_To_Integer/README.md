#iple applies to the number forty, which is written as `XL.` There are six instances where subtraction is used:

1.  I is placed before V (5) and X (10) to form 4 and 9.
2.  X is placed before L (50) and C (100) to form 40 and 90.
3.  C is placed before D (500) and M (1000) to form 400 and 900.

**Example 1**

```java
Input: "VII"
Output: 7
Explanation: V+I+I = 5+1+1 = 7
```


**Example 2**

```java
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
Explanation: The value of I is 1 which is smaller than the value of V i.e. 5. So, we subtract I from V. V-I = 5-1 = 4
```


**Example 3**

```java
Input: "XC"
Output: 90
Explanation: The value of X is 10 which is smaller than the value of C i.e. 100. So, we subtract X from C. C-X = 100-10 = 90
```

**Example 4**

```java
Input: "XVII"
Output: 17
Explanation: X = 10, V= 5, II = 2.0

Given a string `s` representing a roman numeral. Convert `s` into an integer.

**Problem Note**

-   `s` is guaranteed to be within the range from **1** to **3999**.
-   Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols :

```java
SYMBOL       VALUE
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

-   For instance, three is written as `III` in Roman numeral, just three ones added together. Eleven is written as, `XI`, which is simply `X` + `I`. The number fifty-six is written as `LVI`, which is just `L + V + I`.
-   Roman numerals are usually written greatest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. We see that the one is before the five, so we subtract one from five to make it four. The same princ
